This TV plugin for MediaPortal allows users to populate their Electronic Program Guide (EPG) with data from SchedulesDirect. This is useful for users in Canada, US and Mexico.

In addition to populating your guide data, there is also the ability to "enrich" your guide data with SxxExx (season/episode) information for upcoming recording from thetvdb.com
